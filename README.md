# Google-Stock-Price-Prediction

## Problem Statement:
>To predict stock prices of google using a Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) containing LSTM layers and dense layers.

This problem is a classic regression problem and the RNN can be made using the Keras Framework for TensorFlow.
This project is completed as a part of my enrollment in the Deep Learning course taken by Professor Kiril Eremenko and offered on Udemy.

## Dataset:
The required Datasets are attached and named `Google_Stock_Price_Train.csv` &  `Google_Stock_Price_Test.csv` .

The data has been hosted on 

https://www.superdatascience.com/pages/deep-learning

The training set includes around 2 years of data of google's stock prices and the algorithm aims to figure out a trend
of the same. The test set consists of data of stock prices from another year.
